# Sugarcane
Highly optimized Airplane fork based off of Airplain focusing on stability and performance.


# Reminder
These project is still **work in progress**, so there will not have stable build for production for a while, until we did enough test to ensure it's already stable for production.

We **HIGHLY RECOMMAND THAT do not use the development build for any kind of production**
